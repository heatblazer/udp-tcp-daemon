Recorder
========

A wav recorder over udp streams.

Player
======

A wav playback with waveform for listening the records.


## Build
   Added the dummy project for the gui interface of the recorder.

## Usage

    $ ./recd2 -d -c <path-to-conf-file>        # as daemon
    $ ./recd2 -c <path-to-conf-file>           # as normal app
    $ ./recd2 --config <path-to-conf-file>     # as normal app

## Config File

    HotSwap: maxSize in bytes or interval with timer.
    ChannelCount: unused.
    Wave: setup wav file - see the config file.
    Record: setup directories and other stuff for the recorder.
    Network: transport - can be udp or tcp, port to bind to.
    Log: name and path to log - unused for now.
    HeartBeat: send a keep alive packet to client if needed or to port.
    Plugin: name of the plugin, order - priority, enabled - disabled, path - fullpath.

    See the recorder-config.xml for example.
    The release will be preloaded with default settings if no options are given, or
    not proper setup is detected.
## Plugin API

    The program supports plugable programs, that can be loaded by describing them in the
    config file. When a programmer wants to support the program with a plugin, she must
    provide that interface:
        #ifdef __cplusplus
        extern "C"{
        #endif
        struct interface_t
        {
            void (*init)();
            int (*put_ndata)(void* data, int len);
            int (*put_data)(void* data);
            void* (*get_data)(void);
            void (*deinit)();
            int (*main_proxy)(int, char**);
        };

        const struct interface_t* get_interface();
        #ifdef __cplusplus
        }
        #endif

    In brief, I expect the plugin to be able to init and deinit itself, and for now to
    be able to put and get some unknown data, and also to be able to support the C main
    function as the proxy I`ve preserved. So the main can be passed to the plugin. When
    I decide to change the interface, the contributors will be informed.

## TODO
    1. I have to remove the udp-client project when I am done with tests.
    2. I have to encrypt or add a check sum to the samples.
    3. I have to provide install options and "install howto" in build section.
    4. Crypto project and lib for hashing or crypting is still a stub.
    5. GUI for the recorder is stub yet.
    6. I have to add Build/Install instructions and options to the BUILD section.
    7. Daemon logging must support sys/log functionality. Not done yet.
    8. GUI must perform Goertzl algorithm for DTM and filtering the sample data.

## BUGS
~~[Bug1]Strange bug as for 16.11.2016, when the program gives 100% cpu load on my other Fedora computer.~~
    [Fix Bug1] I've forgot a timer into server that has 10ms tick.
