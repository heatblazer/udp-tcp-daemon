udp-server
==========

A wav recorder over udp.


## Build
   Added the dummy project for the gui interface of the recorder.

## Usage

    $ ./udp-server -d # as daemon
    $ ./udp-server    # as normal app

## TODO
    I have to remove the udp-client project when I am done with tests.

## NOTES
    31.10.2016: now correctly records the samples from the incomming device.
